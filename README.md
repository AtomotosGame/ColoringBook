Note:
two things that I want to mentioned

1) create folder for each categories where i can give you the images

2) I need you to ad a version implementation

meaning if we release a new version that the user will prompt to use the new version

and they have no choice but to

in the design I know it shows that we have the categories lock but I want all of it free at first


feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
fix – a bug fix has occurred
chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
docs – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
test – including new or correcting previous tests
perf – performance improvements
ci – continuous integration related
build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
revert – reverts a previous commit


FeedBack

Look a lot of functionality that comes with the templates are not functioning

fixed  1) The images takes too long to load and also it should be cache so that they are not reloading every time



2) when you press back from the image gallery it should take you back to the categories



3) When you color something it doesn't save for some reason



4) When you press the check mark after drawing or color it should take you back to all the save drawing or color



5) The Markers in coloring page need to be center in the middle of the orange background



6) The colors for the bucket needs to center in the middle of the orange background



7) The stickers need to be center in the middle if the orange background



Eight) The pencil and the marker size selection need to have a white ring around the selected size the user can know what they selected



9) The delete button when press needs to alert the user

when I color something I can't see after I leave

and come back

wish is something that the template already had
